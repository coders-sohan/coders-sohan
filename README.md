I am Md. Mofizul Islam. I am from Dhaka. I finished higher secondary school and am looking forward to university admission to graduate in Computer Science and Engineering. My special interest in Web Design and development and my desire for education has brought me to this point.

I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Express JS, MongoDB well. Moreover, I am constantly expanding the scope of my knowledge. I started learning web design first because I liked programming. In its continuation, I have been working hard step by step to develop myself as a competent web developer.

Web development is a very patient job. Which is not possible for everyone. But by doing so, I have developed the mentality of working hard.
